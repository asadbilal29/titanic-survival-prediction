# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the famous [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

## 📦 Project Overview

The goal is to apply Logistic Regression to classify survival based on features like age, fare, class, etc.

Final model achieved **~80% accuracy**.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (optional)

---

## 🧪 Workflow

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training with Logistic Regression
5. Model evaluation
6. Model saving (`logistic_model.pkl`)
