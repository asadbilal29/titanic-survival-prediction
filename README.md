# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning.  
The dataset is from [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Project Overview

- Data loading and exploration  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)  
- Model building using Logistic Regression  
- Model evaluation and accuracy measurement (~80%)  
- Model saving for future use  

## How to Run

1. Load the Jupyter notebook `titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb`  
2. Run the cells step-by-step to reproduce the analysis and model training  
3. Use `logistic_model.pkl` to load the saved model for predictions

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib  
- joblib
