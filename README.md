# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using Logistic Regression.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Contains the dataset file (`train.csv`)
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebook with data exploration, model training, and evaluation
- `models/` - Saved trained model file (`logistic_model.pkl`)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo  
   git clone https://github.com/asadbilal29/titanic-survival-prediction.git

2. Open the notebook in `notebooks/` using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

3. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to train and evaluate the model.

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 79.8% on the test set.

## Future Work

- Experiment with other machine learning models such as Random Forest or XGBoost  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance  
- Add feature engineering and data preprocessing enhancements  
- Implement cross-validation for robust evaluation
